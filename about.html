    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Informatics & Telecommunications graduate with strong foundation in Python, networking, and Linux systems.</p>
    
    <p>Currently focused on developing practical security skills through hands-on projects and self-directed learning in ethical hacking methodologies.</p>
    
    <p>My technical approach combines theoretical knowledge with applied scripting and automation to solve real-world infrastructure and security challenges.</p>
    
    <p>I maintain a security-first mindset while building tools that are both efficient and reliable for network analysis and system monitoring tasks.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of technical work, I believe in continuous learning and contributing to open-source projects that enhance security awareness.</p>
